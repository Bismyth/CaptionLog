In this three-part series, Professor Mary Beard puts aside the stories of emperors and armies to meet the real Romans living at the heart of it all. In the first episode, Mary asks not what the Romans did for us, but what the empire did for Rome. She rides the Via Appia, climbs up to the top seats of the Colosseum, takes a boat to Rome's port Ostia and ventures into the bowels of Monte Testaccio. SBSONE, 26/08/2012, 7:30 PM.",

This Rome is not the marble Rome we know, but a vast, messy metropolis with little urban planning, where most Romans lived in high-rise apartment blocks with little space, light, or even sanitation. Mary looks at the Forum as a place of gamblers, dentists and thieves, and she explores the lustiness of Roman bar life and jokes. Finally, exploring law and order from the bottom up, Mary examines how this city really worked. SBSONE, 02/09/2012, 7:30 PM.",

Many lost their jobs and with their jobs, their identity. Despite all of the negatives associated with the cruel regime of former East Germany, many are experiencing a strange nostalgia for the old times. (German language - English CC) SBS2 PG CC 2012",

We all want to shoot a scene that can be cut together to achieve great continuity with a good variety of shots. The 180-degree rule is a useful tool to help you achieve this. In this segment we talk about the basic principles of the rule, establishing action lines, working with shifting action lines, and redefining the action line using neutral shots, camera movement, and cutaways. Knowing how to apply the 180-degree rule, and when you might want to break it can take your production skills to a higher level.

To better understand the way the underwater world works, this film monitors fish stocks in Massachusetts and joins scientists monitoring humpback whales in the North Atlantic. Sir David also visits the Great Barrier Reef to meet scientists struggling to save this unique habitat from the effects of climate change.  So what can be done to save this fragile ecosystem? This film will transform how we see the ocean, giving us a better picture of what lives there, our impact and what the future holds.

Plucking a stretched rubber band makes the rubber band vibrate. Air molecules around the rubber band move, pushing other air molecules. As the rubber band continues to vibrate, it sends waves of sound through the air. It's a lot like the ripples you see when you drop a rock into a pond. You hear sound when rippling air pushes on tiny bones in your ears. Nerves in your ears send a message to your brain about the sound you're hearing.\r\n\r\nhttps://clickv.ie/w/dufh\r\n\r\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://online.clickview.com.au/share/embed?shareCode=da276886&a=false\"></iframe>",

Igneous rocks are made from cooled lava. Sedimentary rocks are made from small pieces of other rocks stuck together. Metamorphic rocks are formed when other rocks are heated or pressed, or both. One type of rock can change into another type of rock as the Earth's surface shifts and changes. It takes the right conditions and a lot of time. When rocks break down into smaller and smaller pieces, they become soil. The pieces of rock mixed together with decaying plants and animals give new plants a place to grow and give earthworms, insects, and the tiny de-composer organisms a place to live.\r\n\r\nhttps://clickv.ie/w/JTbi\r\n\r\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://online.clickview.com.au/share/embed?shareCode=116b96ee&a=false\"></iframe>",

They did not take family snapshots or videos 65 million years ago. The only proof scientists have of dinosaurs is their fossils, especially bones. They would never have survived billions of years waiting for some human to trip over them. The meteorite impact is just a theory, but a very, very good one. We may never be sure what really happened because, as this episode of Bill Nye the Science Guy points out: dinosaurs and humans did not live at the same time!\r\nBlurb copied: https://billnye.com/billnye_resource/dinosaurs/\r\n\r\nhttps://clickv.ie/w/0_Xi\r\n\r\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://online.clickview.com.au/share/embed?shareCode=16f6ffb4&a=false\" allow=\"autoplay\"></iframe>",

You flip a switch, and the lights turn on. You push the play button, and your personal stereo starts playing music. When you flip the switch or push play, you start a flow of electrons. Electricity is the flow of electrons, and electrons are very tiny charged particles. Electrons are found in atoms, the tiny pieces that all stuff is made from.

        "description": "New Zealand TV show. In 1988, Ivan Curry, 21 years old and profoundly deaf, was arrested in the New Zealand town of Waitotara for the murder of his 15-month-old nephew. He was remanded without bail for the next two years. In the 1990 trial, the jury took only two hours to find Curry not guilty. More than a comment on the fallibility of the court system, the documentary draws attention to the difficulties of self-representation for disabled people as a minority group. The figure of Curry playing himself in dramatised sequences intensifies the need to address this in 'real-life' as the final lines echo \" No one ever said sorry to Ivan ... there is no compensation for Ivan Curry.\" The interweaving of conventional documentary interview techniques with dramatic reenactments of court proceedings highlights the artificial construction of police charges brought against Curry.",

This is the world's biggest vacuum chamber, used to test spacecraft in space-like conditions.  In the experiment, Cox raises a bowling ball and feathers above the ground.  Almost all of the air is removed from the chamber to make it a vacuum.  The objects are then dropped and hit the ground at the same time, this is because there is no air resistance and they 'fall' at the same rate. But Professor Cox explains they are not 'falling' at all, but rather adhering to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.

Instead, they have hard shells called exoskeletons. Like a little suit of armor, an exoskeleton protects the insect's body and also keeps it from drying out. Although people call any crawling critter with an exoskeleton a \"bug\", the \"true bugs\" are insects that have special mouth parts for piercing and sucking. And, spiders are not bugs or even insects. They're built differently with only two main body parts and eight legs instead of six. Blurb copied: https://billnye.com/the-science-guy/insects.

The stories show both the positives and negatives of their experiences, with some of the CODAs becoming very emotional as they tell their stories, particularly in cases where they've left their 'Deaf' lives behind.

Pollen and a stigma are the two components needed for fertilisation. Most plants carry both these within their flowers and rely on animals to transport the pollen from one to the stigma of another. To do this, they attract their couriers with colour, scent and nectar. It isn't just birds that help pollination: some mammals and reptiles also do so. However, it is mostly insects that are recruited to carry out the task. Blurb copied: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Life_of_Plants",
