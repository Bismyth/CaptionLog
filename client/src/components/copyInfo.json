Either way, they can be shown to the students. The Deaf Education Centre has information on what DVDs are available commercially.\nIf the DVD/media is not available through any of these means, the Deaf Education Centre can caption a copy of the media. The school must have a purchased copy of the DVD before we can make another copy for captioning."

        "text": "Schools are now mandated to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Disability Standards for Education 2005. The Act and Standards place an obligation on schools to ensure that all students who are Deaf or hard of hearing are provided with equitable access to the curriculum. Measures for compliance with the Standards include the availability of materials in a format that is appropriate for the student. (Disability Standards for Education 2005 sections 5.2 (1) and 6.2 (1)).\nThe Disability Standards for Education 2005 also places an obligation on schools to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by the time taken for conversion of materials into alternative accessible formats. (Disability Standards for Education 2005 section 6.3(c)).\nIn addition the Standards provide for staff to be informed of the availability of specialised services to enable them to assist students to access these services. (Disability Standards for Education 2005 section 7.3(a)).\nIn reference to the Disability Standards for Education 2005 schools may already be able to meet these obligations because many commercially produced DVDs come with pre-installed captions/subtitles. However there are still a number of items being used in schools which do not have this feature."
